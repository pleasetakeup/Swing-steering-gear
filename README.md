# pn532
The PN532 is a highly integrated transmission module for contactless communication at 13.56 MHz including microcontroller functionality based on an 80C51 core with 40 Kbytes of ROM and 1 Kbytes of RAM. 
The PN532 combines a modulation and demodulation concept completely integrated for different kinds of contactless communication methods and protocols at 13.56 MHz with an easy-to-use firmware for the different supported modes and the required host controller interfaces. 
This example is for pn532 chip reads and writes CARDS.

## Summary

Provide an Arduino library to control the nfc module to get data from card and writes data  to card .

## Installation

To use this library, first download the library file, paste it into the \Arduino\libraries directory, then open the examples folder and run the demo in the folder.

## Methods

```C++	

#include <DFrobot_nfc.h>

    /*
     * @brief reads a page of data from the target card(there are 16 bytes of data per page).
     * @param The number of pages you want to read the data.
     * @return a page of data 
     */   
     String readData(int page);
	 
	/*
     * @brief reads a data from the page which you want .
     * @param page: the number of pages you want to read the data.
	 * @param num: the offset of the data that you want. 
     * @return a data from the card. 
     */
	 int  readData(int page, uint8_t num);
	 
	/*
     * @brief write a data to card  .
     * @param page: the number of pages you want to writes the data .
	 * @param num:the offset of the data . 
	 * @param data:the data content.
     */  
	 void  writeData (int page, uint8_t num ,uint8_t data);
	 
	/*
     * @brief find out if there is a card. 
	 * @return True means find out a card.
     */ 
	 bool  scan(void);
	 
	/*
     * @brief find out if there is a specific card.
     * @param a string of card Numbers.
     * @return True means success.
     */   
	 bool  scan(String uid);
	 
	/*
     * @brief get the id of the card .
     * @return  the card's id.
     */  
     String  readUid();
	 
	 /*
     * @brief write sixteen data on the card.
     * @param block :The number of pages you want to write data on.
	 * @param data[]:the name of arry name which has sixteen data . 
     */  
	 void  writeData(int block, uint8_t data[]);
	 
```
